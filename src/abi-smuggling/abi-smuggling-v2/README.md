This challenge has some key differences from the previous one:

1. Different Permission System:
   - Uses role-based access control (ADMIN_ROLE and DONOR_ROLE)
   - Player only has DONOR_ROLE
   - Different function selectors and permission checks

2. Different Vulnerabilities:
   - Still uses a hardcoded offset for selector reading (but different value)
   - Different internal function checks
   - Has additional time-based restrictions

3. Challenge Goals:
   - Player needs to bypass role checks
   - Needs to execute `distributeFunds` despite only having DONOR_ROLE
   - Must transfer all funds to the beneficiary address

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:
1. Find a way to bypass the role checks using ABI smuggling
2. Execute `distributeFunds` despite only having DONOR_ROLE
3. Transfer all funds to the beneficiary
4. The vault should end up with 0 balance
5. The beneficiary should receive all funds

Key things to consider:
1. How the selector is read from calldata
2. How permissions are checked
3. The calldata structure needed to bypass checks
4. How to craft the payload to execute your desired function
